# Problem Statement

Marine plastic pollution is a critical environmental threat that affects ocean biodiversity, human health, and coastal economies. Plastic waste that accumulates on beaches represents one of the most visible and hazardous forms of marine debris. Traditional beach litter surveys are conducted manually by volunteers or researchers, which makes them time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale across large geographic regions.

To address this challenge, there is a growing need for automated image-based systems capable of detecting, classifying, and quantifying plastic litter on coastal beaches. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning models, visual recognition of litter can enable faster and more objective environmental monitoring.

This project aims to develop a computer vision-based image classification and segmentation model that can automatically identify and localize plastic litter on beaches using real-world images from the BePLi Dataset v1 (Beach Plastic Litter Dataset).

# Dataset 

The BePLi Dataset v1 is a large-scale image dataset specifically designed for machine learning and computer vision research in beach litter detection. It focuses exclusively on plastic litter that has washed up or accumulated on coastal beaches.

The dataset contains 3,700+ high-resolution RGB images collected under diverse real-world conditions — including different lighting, weather, and beach surface types — to enhance model robustness and generalization.

Each image is fully annotated with pixel-level segmentation masks identifying areas of plastic litter, making it suitable for both image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
